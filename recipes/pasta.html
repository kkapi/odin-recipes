    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My mom made up this flavorful pasta.
         It's very simple and great with fresh tomatoes for a summer
          night meal! Add shrimp or chicken for a heartier version of this pasta.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>            
            <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium
                 heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes;
                  drain water, reserving 1 cup pasta water.</p>
        </li>
        <li>           
            <p>
                Melt butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat;
                 add zucchini, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
                  Cook and stir zucchini mixture in the melted butter until 
                  most of the moisture has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion
                 until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes, remaining 2 cloves 
                 minced garlic, salt, and pepper to onion; cook and stir, crushing tomatoes
                  to desired consistency, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Mix fettuccine and zucchini mixture into onion mixture, adding as much reserved
                 pasta water to keep pasta moist. Stir goat cheese and basil into pasta mixture.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
