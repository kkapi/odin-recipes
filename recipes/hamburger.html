    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives it a rich and creamy taste.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prep: 5 mins</li>
        <li>Cook: 15 min</li>
        <li>Total: 20 min</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>        
        <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>            
            <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>           
            <p>
                Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, 
                and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; 
                flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese 
                onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese
                 with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the 
                 cheese into the center.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired 
                degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read
                 thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
